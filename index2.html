    </ol>
    <p>Ever since i got my first computer when i was younger i had this wish to learn more about it.
        trying all i could to get a free version of minecraft was the hell of my life because, wel, i got a lot of viruses.
        but still it was really fun, now im in colege and learning more and more every day
